Rev (formerly 'gyt') is (the start of) an implementation of Git-like ideas in
Python.

It's not intended to be a port of Git to Python. It's more designed as an
exploration of how Git works and how the concepts might be applied to other
tasks. In particular, I'm interested in exploring its use for versioning
in-memory data structures rather than blobs on disk.

So in a way, Rev is to Git what Rel is to a relational databases. In fact,
the two might have some strong tie, in terms of Rev being used to version
relations.

Rev will probably look less and less like Git internals over time.
